      <p>Hello there! I'm Geoffrey, and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in physics at the University of Chicago. </p>
      <p>I enjoy thinking and learning about <b>physics, math</b>, and <b>linguistics.</b></p>
    
      <section id="research" style="padding-top: 30px;">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I am currently a graduate student in the <a href="https://demillegroup.psd.uchicago.edu/">DeMille group</a> in the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago. 
        We are a group of experimental atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physicists who are broadly interested in using cold and ultracold molecules 
        for applications in quantum science and precision studies of physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>
        
        <p>For my PhD thesis work, I have worked on three separate but thematically related projects. For the first project of my PhD, I worked on the <a href="https://demillegroup.psd.uchicago.edu/research/laser-cooling-and-trapping-of-srf-molecules-towards-a-quantum-gas-of-polar-molecules/">strontium monofluoride</a>
        (SrF) molecular laser cooling experiment. Starting with a cryogenic buffer gas beam of dipolar SrF molecules, we use laser slowing, cooling, and trapping techniques to load up to 10<sup>4</sup> molecules into a magneto-optical trap (MOT). My work focused on pioneering more advanced cooling and trapping protocols
        to make the cloud of molecules colder and denser. This included experimental realization of a regular and a conveyor-belt blue-detuned MOT of SrF molecules, implementing quantum state preparation schemes using resonant microwaves to drive rotational transitions in the molecules, and leading the design of 
        a free-space, high-power microwave delivery system for microwave shielding of the molecules. A colder and denser cloud of gas-phase, laser-cooled dipolar molecules would serve as an exquisite platform for studies of exotic quantum physics.</p>

        <p>For the second project of my PhD, I used the knowledge I gained from studying molecular laser cooling and applied it to study the feasability of laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of an entirely new class of elements on the periodic table.
        To date, no elements in Group IV (which include carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, and lead) have been laser cooled or magneto-optically trapped before. Applying these modern atomic and quantum physics techniques to these elements would 
        open the door to a wealth of new applications in quantum science and precision measurement. I was the first author on a paper in which we performed numerical simulations to confirm that Group IV elements can be laser cooled and trapped. I am now leading a follow-up paper
        to calculate relevant parameters for a proposed experiment to study electroweak nuclear properties in laser-cooled, optically trapped ultracold tin atoms.</p>
          
        <p>For the final project of my PhD, I will use the knowledge I gained from working on molecular laser cooling to study quantum state preparation schemes in a beam of barium monofluoride (BaF) molecules. The Zombies experiment hosted at Argonne National Laboratory
        aims to use a beam of BaF molecules to measure the nuclear anapole moment of the barium nucleus, which is another stringent probe of electroweak nuclear physics. Quantum state preparation of the molecules in the beam enables more 
        sensitive measurements to be performed in the future. </p>
